    "### Explanation of the Build Process for the Network\n",
    "\n",
    "We built the rock performers network through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Collection:**\n",
    "We started by fetching the wikitext page of the \"List of Mainstream Rock Performers\". This gave us a lot of unnecessary information, when we only really needed the links. Therefore, using a regex pattern, we created a new txt file with only the list of performers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Page Download:**\n",
    "After collecting the list of all the performers, we proceeded to make a new directory and download all the individual artists' pages into individual .txt files. For this step, we encountered some issues with some artists having special characters in their names, which are not valid for filenames, such as \"AC/DC\" and \"Panic! at the Disco\", where \"/\" and \"!\" are not valid in filenames. Therefore, we needed to sanitize these by replacing them with \"_\". This turned out to help us in the end, since bands with whitespaces in their names have \"_\" in the Wikipedia URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Link Extraction:**\n",
    "To extract the links on each of the artists' wiki-pages, we used a regex pattern to look for the specific \"[[...]]\" or \"[[...|...]]\" format. Furthermore, we made sure to save these in a 'set' to avoid duplicate links, since we do not care about how *many* times artists are linked, just the fact that they *are*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Network Construction:**\n",
    "To create the network:\n",
    "- We started by initializing a directed graph (G)\n",
    "- Looping over all performers in our list, for each performer we did the following:\n",
    "  - Added the performer's name to G as a node\n",
    "  - Used our helper function to count the number of words on their page and set this as \"content_length\"\n",
    "  - Used our link extraction function to extract the links, making sure to filter any links which do not point to another artist\n",
    "  - Finally, created directed edges to the other nodes corresponding to the links between performers\n",
    "- The resulting network had 488 nodes and 7,267 edges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Network Cleaning:**\n",
    "We also inspected the network to identify any performers who are not linked to any other performers - there turned out to be 4 of those, so we removed them from the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most Difficult Part**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most difficult part was setting up the Wikipedia download and figuring out why we couldn't save some of the performers' wiki-text to a file. Furthermore, getting the regex just right also took some trial and error. Finally, because we changed some of the artist names in our list, we had trouble downloading their content, so we needed to \"convert\" their names to match their URL names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use of LLMs**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the network build, we used LLMs to help set up the API. We had some errors with 403 Forbidden, since we initially did not have a header for our API call. Furthermore, we had help developing the regex pattern and finally also help with the filename sanitization and following reconstruction for downloading the pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What We Would Do Differently**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had to do this again, we would start with better research on how the data in Wikipedia is represented. We would also make a clearer mapping between our filenames and the actual URLs so that we did not need to deal with this issue. We might also benefit from better error handling, since we spent a fair bit of time trying to understand what was going wrong."
